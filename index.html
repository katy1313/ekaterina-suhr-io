                    My name is Ekaterina. I'm highly self-motivated and diligent Quality Assurance professional with 4 years of experience in testing Web and Mobile products. Adaptable to rapidly changing environments, a great team player capable of working with minimal supervision, and a quick learner. I enjoy learning new things, creating art, and working out. One of my latest hobbies is growing houseplants and rollerskating.
